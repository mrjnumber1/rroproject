While this seems like a lot of work, when you go to change back to a Second Class Job, you will become a Transcendent Second Class Job with brand new powerful skills that you did not have before, as well as the ability to grow 20 more skill points that you could not have before.";

Both are a valued ally when going into Siege or Battlegrounds.";

Hunters can manage Area Control with their Traps which will either halt their enemies progress or deal damage to them.";

Certain gun specializations favor Burst Damage and Area Control while others are aimed at dealing high damage to a single target. Gunslingers are an excellent duelist and able to face down most monsters with ease.";

			next;
			mes .npcname$;
			mes "The Super Novice is a special path that any Novice can take if they're willing to level to Base 45. A Super Novice can learn any of the First Class Job skills. They can pick and choose their skills carefully to take on monsters as they wish. Unfortunately, when it comes to Siege and Battlegrounds, you'd probably be better off going with a real expert than these jack of all trades.";

The Taekwon can choose to become the Star Gladiator, a powerful warrior who channels the Moon, the Sun, and the Stars to gain their true power. Monsters who Star Gladiators have marked as their enemies will soon face a beatdown of universal proportions. ";
			next;
			mes .npcname$;
			mes "Or the Taekwon can choose to become the Soul Linker. They call on the power of their ancestors to use the Soul Link which unlocks the hidden abilities of the other classes. Soul Linkers also have strong defensive Ka magic which make them a useful ally in any Siege or Battlegrounds engagement. Even though Soul Linkers have given up TaeKwon Do, when it comes to fighting monsters, they can also use Es magic to blast their foes. A Soul Linker won't be able to specialize though in both Ka and Es magic along with the Soul Links, so the Soul Linker must decide whether they want to focus their talents towards helping other players or fighting monsters.";
			next;
			mes .npcname$;
			mes "A TaeKwon who chooses to not change to the Star Gladiator or the Soul Linker can also choose to become a TaeKwon Ranker, but they must complete TaeKwon missions and compete with other TaeKwon Rankers to stay ranked, otherwise they lose access to the Ranker Bonus.";
