7012#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The conversation with Echinacea was a rather one-sided talk. You have been assigned to be Mr. Kidd's assistant so you better go speak to him.#
Mr. Kidd#

7013#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
...You have expressed that you're not comfortable with doing chores and Mr. Kidd tells you to be clear with Echinacea that you don't want the task.#
Echinacea#

7014#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
...Well, it was still impossible to win Echinacea over. You should just go back and help Mr. Kidd no matter what.#
Mr. Kidd#

7015#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Mr. Kidd's request was simpler than you thought. At Southwest Morroc, you must meet Rin at the underground tavern.#
Rin#

7016#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You must investigate the region where Rin was ambushed. The area is somewhere west of Abyss Lake and south of the second hill from the top of the mountain...#
Investigate the West field of Abyss Lake#

7017#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You have found a Bloody Crystal of Darkness near the forest of Hugel. You should report this to Rin.#
Report to Rin#

7018#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You've got the journal and a Bloody Crystal of Darkness from Rin. It's now your job to deliver these to Mr. Kidd!#
Deliver the journal and crystal to Mr. Kidd#

7019#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You have delivered the journal and a crystal to Kidd, but you can't get his last words off of your mind...#
#

7020#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
All of a sudden, you started to feel furious and couldn't stop the urge to beat up those enemies.#
Stop all the Dandelions#

7021#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You have found a Sealed Magic Scroll from one of the of a Dandelion Gang's bodies. It must be something important so you should bring it to Mr. Kidd.#
Report to Mr. Kidd#

7022#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You need to investigate the magic spell scroll. Echinacea knows which scholar to consult about it.#
Echinacea#

7023#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Echinacea has introduced a scholar named 'Defaria' but where is he? Is he the one baking sweet potatoes?#
Speak to Defaria#

7024#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The old scholar Defaria requested for some materials to unseal the scroll.#
30 of each Holy Water, Rune of Darkness, Bloody Rune#

7025#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You need to get all the required materials. Defaria said, 'I’ll be waiting for your return.'#
Conversation with Defaria#

7026#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The scroll is unsealed. Such scrolls are generally used by ^4d4dfforganizations to gather their members^000000. He says you should use it now but it's a question whether you should talk to Mr. Kidd first.#
#

7027#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You heard some suspicious story while investigating the building where you arrived by using the scroll. You heard that the Dandelions are fighting each other..#
Report to Mr. Kidd#

7028#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You told Mr. Kidd what you've heard from the basement in the empty house near the national border. There will be a serious internal dispute and it'd be the perfect time to raid them.#
Investigate the empty house near the national border#

7029#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Rayan Moore is finally caught. Mr. Kidd will take him to Rin so she can interrogate him. Find out more details from Mr. Kidd#
Conversation with Mr. Kidd#

7030#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Mr. Kidd has given you the Bloody Crystal of Darkness as well as a journal. Your last assignment is to bring the journal to Rin#
Deliver the journal to Rin#

7031#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Rayan has escaped. Or, could it be Satan Morocc who took him? You must give the pattern number of the magic wavelength to Echinacea with the journal.#
The pattern number is [SDHF92F-SDF]#

7032#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Rayan has escaped. Or, could it be Satan Morocc who took him? You must give the pattern number of the magic wavelength to Echinacea with the journal.#

Rayan has escaped. Or, could it be Satan Morocc who took him? You must give the pattern number of the magic wavelength to Echinacea with the journal.#
The pattern number is [CM3-TRDFGHE0]#

7034#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Echinacea is analyzing the pattern number to detect the magic wavelength strength. This could lead us to Rayan and maybe even Satan Morocc...#
#

7035#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Go to the building with a mana detector attached to it at the south of this camp and ask about the trace results.#
#

7036#Pursuing Rayan Moore#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The trace failed but the Manager says that since the stone is still intact that Rayan must still be alive somewhere. Report to Echinacea and ask her if she has any ideas on tracing Rayan Moore.#
Report to Echinacea#

7037#Case closed?#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The case is closed now, but what is this thing that still lingers in your head? You should ask somebody about the Dandelion request because Echinacea isn't being too helpful.#
#

7038#Passion for Baked Sweet Potatoes#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You have consulted Defaria about your concern, but all you got was a chore to gather some materials for baking sweet potatoes...#
20 Sweet Potatoes and 30 Logs#

7039#Dodging the conversation#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You questioned Defaria over and over again and he seemed to start talking about Dandelion. But, he changed the subject again and asked you to deliver some sweet potatoes to Mr. Kidd.#
Deliver 2 sweet potatoes to Mr. Kidd#

7040#Dodging the conversation#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
This time, the conversation got a bit deeper, but at last, all you got was a chore to deliver the sweet potatoes again...!#

You fell between giant roots of a tree. You've found a giant tribe called the 'Sapha,' hard as rocks and big as mountain. Seems like there's no more traces left from Terra.#
Report to Arch#

7059#Messenger - Terra's Whereabouts#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Arc's worried that Terra went off with Bradium from the Lab without permission. Terra could have gone to the 'Sapha' in that 'Cave' with a Bradium.#
Find Terra#

When you arrived to see the Sapha, Terra was already long gone. Very bright pieces of mineral were scattered around the hardened giant. These pieces must be the Bradium.#

Shay is the manager of 'Burman Flone', the Pub of El Dicastes. He suggested to obtain some information about 'the guy with animal ears' from the Sapha who live in the capital.#

Cat ears? You sure? Are you humans always like that? Why don't you just go to meet Ahat. He is a very strong Sapha. He may be a Jarute working through piles of documents but he must be hiding his power!!#

11061#Coward Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
He looked pale and asked me a high-strength adhesive. He might have broken something important. I told him to go look in the bar where bunch of guys usually are at.#
Looks like Mikhail went to the bar. Go to the bar and find him.#

11062#Coward Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I don't know much about adhesives so I introduced Mikhail an expert, that guy over there named Victor.#
Lookslike Mikhail is no longer at the bar.  Ask Victor about Mikhail's whereabouts.#

11063#Coward Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Here you are. This is what you ordered. Have fun!#
Approach Victor while drinking.#

11064#Coward Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
To get the stuff for a high-strength adhesive, we should go to  an isloated swamp. I don't believe that the little and timid boy like Mikhail goes there.#
Where would he be? Maybe you should go to the swamp just in case.#

11065#Coward Mikhail#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You feel sticky just when you see a swamp.  Gas bubbles are rising. The atmosphere  here is pretty fearful.#
I don't see any traces. Firest, I'm going back to Mikhail's.#

You searched the house again and found Mikhail hiding inside the fire pot. Let's get the adhesive to help Mikhail fix Matroshuca.#
Go back to Victor to ask what materials are needed to make the adhesive exactly.#

I beg of you. Please do not let him bring any harm to the lord. I am pretty sure he's been asking you, as well as others, for aid... Please interrupt him from carrying out his plan.#
Get rid of the drink bottle of Bai Long.#

11080#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You take the drink bottle and replace it with a bottle filled with Sticky Mucus. Hopefully Bai Long won't notice!#

Meet Friends of Frede, Brian, John, Tyler, Rose, Bain, and Lash.#

11173#Request from Frede#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#

Meet Bouy and get refined Bradium.#

11174#Supply Shortage#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#

There is not enough Bradium. Collect 30 small pieces of Bradium.#

11175#Supply Shortage#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Handwork is much faster to refine pieces of Bradium instead of using a machine. I will only need an hour to finish. Please go rest while I get to work.#
The job seems to need 2 hours to be done.#

11176#For my friends#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
