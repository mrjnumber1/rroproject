			mes "[Battle Tutor]";
			mes "You can also just hold down the left mouse button while the cursor is on the monster. Still, there are some people who are even too lazy to use the '^4D4DFFCtrl^000000' key every time they attack a monster.";

		mes "a skill or weapon that inflicts damage of the same property as the monster, the damage will be greatly reduced, or completely negated. You might even heal the monster!";
